# GameCube-Wasp-QSB
Somewhat easy to install Gamecube QSBs for WiiKey Fusion and Wasp Fusion.  DVD QSB works with audio streaming titles.

**This guide assumes you already familiar with the Wasp & WKF.  So I will not be going over the LID/Pin29 usage.  These pads are labeled on the Host QSB**

**All Part numbers are digikey**


There are three QSBs:
